Simple download apps to list files from server and download to your device using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf.

I used to transfer files between devices through Wi-Fi with this without flashdisk or harddisk.

change the 'root-path' at application.yml to directory path you wanted, for example: 'C:\' for windows or '/home/' for 
linux to make it as root path. run apps and open 'localhost:8765/list' to see all files the directory and click 
file to download.
